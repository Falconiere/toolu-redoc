# AGENTS.md — @toolu-redoc/config

Read this first. This package is shared lint configuration and nothing else.

## What this package is

Two oxlint bases, extended by every other workspace package and app:

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `base.oxlintrc.json` | The house rules: type-aware correctness, no barrels, no deep relative imports, kebab-case filenames, the `house/*` plugin rules. |
| `base-react.oxlintrc.json` | React additions (`react/*`, `react-hooks/*`) for anything that renders JSX. |

There is **no `src/`, no `vitest.config.ts`, and no `guardrails.config.json`** —
a lint-config package ships no code for a structure check or a test runner to
have an opinion about.

## Hard rules

1. **No source tree.** If this package ever needs one, it has stopped being a
   config package — split the new code into `packages/ui` or `packages/types`,
   or a new package, instead of growing one here.
2. **No source tree, and the `package.json` stays minimal.** It declares the
   two bases in its `exports` map and one script — the format check — because
   that is the only gate a package with no code can honestly run. The packages
   that extend these bases install `oxlint` themselves.
3. **Extend, do not fork.** A consuming package's `.oxlintrc.json` points its
   `extends` array at these files rather than copying rules into its own
   config — one copy of the rules, not one per package.

## Gate

There is no `bun run check` here — nothing to type-check, lint, or test. The
workspace root's gate does not list this package because it carries no
`guardrails.config.json`.
