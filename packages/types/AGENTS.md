# AGENTS.md — @toolu-redoc/types

Read this first. This package is the shared contracts and nothing else.

## What this package is

Zod schemas that cross a boundary between two workspace packages or apps, each
with its type inferred rather than hand-written beside it. It has **no
`index.ts`** — its public surface is the `exports` map in `package.json`,
which points at concrete files.

## Repo map

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/contracts/` | One file per contract: a zod schema, its inferred type, and a `parse*` function. |

## Hard rules

1. **One schema per file**, named after what it exports, with its type
   inferred via `z.infer` — never a hand-written interface beside it.
2. **No barrels.** No `index.ts`. Add a public entry by adding a subpath to the
   `exports` map, pointing at the concrete file.
3. **Every contract ships a `parse*` function.** A schema nobody calls `.parse`
   on is not enforcing anything at the boundary.
4. **No I/O.** This package validates shapes; it does not fetch, read files, or
   read `process.env`. That belongs to the caller.
5. **Nothing unused.** TypeScript/oxlint rejects unused locals and parameters,
   including `_name`; knip rejects unused files, exports, and dependencies.
   Delete or wire the code; never add an ignore pattern.
6. **`max-lines: 300`**, code lines only.

## Gate

`bun run check` — typecheck, lint, format-check, guardrails, knip, jscpd, and
tests. From the workspace root, `bun run --filter '*' check` runs it for every
package.

Never run oxlint from the workspace root: it resolves `guardrails.config.json`
from the working directory, and there is deliberately none there.
