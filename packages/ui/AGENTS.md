# AGENTS.md — @toolu-redoc/ui

Read this first. This package is shared React components and nothing else.

## What this package is

Plain React 19 components, bundler-free. It has **no build step and no
`index.ts`** — its public surface is the `exports` map in `package.json`,
which points at concrete files that consumers import directly.

## Repo map

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/components/` | Shared components. `surface.tsx` is the example — a div that forwards `className` and `children`, no styling of its own. |
| `src/utilities/` | Shared pure helpers, like `class-names.ts`. |

## Hard rules

1. **No colour, spacing, or typography baked into a component.** Those are the
   consuming app's Tailwind utilities, passed in through `className`.
   `house/no-hardcoded-hex` fails the lint on a literal hex value.
2. **No barrels.** No `index.ts`. Add a public entry by adding a subpath to the
   `exports` map, pointing at the concrete file.
3. **No bundler dependency.** This package ships no build; consumers resolve
   the TS/TSX source directly. Do not add a dependency that only works after a
   bundler transform runs.
4. **Named exports only.** `import/no-default-export` fails the lint.
5. **Tests render real components.** `@testing-library/react`, jsdom, and
   assertions on what a user would see — never a mocked render.
6. **Nothing unused.** TypeScript/oxlint rejects unused locals and parameters,
   including `_name`; knip rejects unused files, exports, and dependencies.
   Delete or wire the code; never add an ignore pattern.
7. **`max-lines: 300`**, code lines only.

## Gate

`bun run check` — typecheck, lint, format-check, guardrails, knip, jscpd, and
tests. From the workspace root, `bun run --filter '*' check` runs it for every
package.

Never run oxlint from the workspace root: it resolves `guardrails.config.json`
from the working directory, and there is deliberately none there.
