# folder-tree.sh — the allowed source tree shape.
#
# Two rules from one config block:
#   src.topLevel  the only directories permitted directly under srcRoot
#   src.nested    a glob-keyed allowlist of subdirectories, which is how
#                 intra-domain shape is expressed — "domains/*" constrains
#                 every feature folder without naming any of them
#
# src.requireReadme is NOT here: it is a fact about README files, which oxlint
# never lints, so it lives in its own `folder-readmes` check. That separation is
# load-bearing. `ownedByLinter` is keyed on check id, and every TypeScript stack
# declares folder-tree linter-owned — so while the README rules lived in this
# function, declaring it owned switched them off in the bash module while nothing
# in the oxlint plugin ever picked them up. One check id, one enforcement surface.
#
# src.topLevel OMITTED means unconstrained. An empty array means nothing is
# allowed. They are different. The Rust stack sets topLevel to the delivery
# shells (cli · http · …) plus domains/.

# gr_ft_allow_for <parent-rel-dir> — the allowlist governing this directory's
# children, empty when no key matches (unconstrained). Reads the cached map;
# no subprocess.
