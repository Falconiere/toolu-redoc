# workspace.sh — monorepo dispatch: fan every mode out across the packages.
#
# The shape of the problem: all three wired invocations run with the working
# directory at the REPO ROOT — PostToolUse and Stop from .claude/settings.json,
# and lefthook's {staged_files}. A workspace root has no guardrails.config.json,
# so without this module gr_load_config would exit 3 on every one of them and
# enforcement layers 2 and 3 would be dead while looking correctly wired up.
#
# Why re-exec instead of a loop in this process: gr_cache_config reads every
# value ONCE into plain shell globals (GR_FILE_MAX, GR_TOPLEVEL, …). A second
# package handled in the same process would inherit the first one's ceilings and
# allowlists — and ownedByLinter differs per package, so the wrong checks would
# be skipped too. A child process starts from nothing, which is exactly the
# isolation we need. The cost is one fork per package; run-latency.sh holds it
# to the same budget as a single-root tree.
#
# The checks themselves are untouched. Each child runs with its working
# directory INSIDE its package, which is the single-root case they were written
# for.

# The root subset. Only the checks that read repo-level facts rather than a
# source tree — there is no srcRoot at a workspace root for the others to walk.
